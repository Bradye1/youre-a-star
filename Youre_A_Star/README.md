Hello! Thanks for checking out my project. If you have Processing installed, installation is easy:
- Download the folder containing all .pde files.
- Open the files in Processing and hit start.
- As the instructions printed to the screen say, hit space to start the search when the maze finishes generating.
- When the search is complete, restart the sketch to do it again (hit start again in Processing or press the "r" key).

Please let me know if you have any issues or questions!
